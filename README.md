This is a repository for sharing our graph-based neural weather prediction models for Limited Area Modeling (LAM).
We hope to make this a dynamic repository where we can share updates to our implementation and collaborate with others interesting in machine learning models for LAM.

See [our preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17370 ) for information about the different models and methodology.

The initial code contains PyTorch implementations of graph-based models adapted to the LAM setting, including:

* The graph-based model from [Keisler (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07575).
* GraphCast, by [Lam et al. (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12794).
* A new hierarchical model (see [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17370)).

Currently we are using these models on a limited area covering the Nordic region.

## Code release
We are currently in the process of documenting and doing some refactoring of the codebase.
We expect to release a first version of our implementation in October 2023.

## Contact
If you are interested in machine learning models for LAM, have questions about our implementation or ideas for extending it, feel free to get in touch.
Either send an email to [joel.oskarsson@liu.se](mailto:joel.oskarsson@liu.se) or open a github issue on this page.
